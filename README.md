# Dirt Road Kennel
## Description
This project is a fully responsive e-commerce/portolio website for Dirt Road kennels, a dog breeder. 
The end user should be able to veiw all dog photos, purchase a dog, contact J(the business owner), learn about the business and people who contributed to it,
read about the best ways to care for their bully. It will be done using HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, JS but I would also like to use google analytics api and do the backend.
